## SLIDE 1: Title Slide
**LLMs Replacing Government Consulting**
- Revolutionizing Public Sector Efficiency
- Presented by: Ayush Kumar Jha
- Date: January 2026
- Vision: 60-80% Cost Reduction | 2-3x Speed Improvement

## SLIDE 2: The Problem (Static Title)
Governing bodies spend $100-500 billion annually on consulting:
- 87% of IT projects over $6M fail
- 80% of budgets exceeded by average 50%
- $75+ billion wasted annually due to inefficiency
- Top 10 firms control $65+ billion of market
- Lack of IP ownership for agencies

**Impact:** Citizens, staff, budgets suffer from inefficiency

## SLIDE 3: Why This Matters Now
**The Perfect Storm:**
1. LLM Technology Matured (GPT-4, Claude 3, Llama)
2. Government Modernization Pressure (Executive Orders)
3. Budget Constraints (Fiscal Pressures)
4. Digital-First Requirements (Post-COVID)
5. AI Adoption Acceleration (Competitive Pressure)

**Historical Parallels:**
